This is some VBE/DDC stuff.  It makes calls to the VESA extensions in the BIOS
using a slightly modified version of Josh Vanderhoof's LRMI 0.6, and generally
requires a 2.2 or newer kernel.  The idea for reading EDID data from the BIOS
came from Matt Wilson <msw@gimp.org>, as well as several ideas about better ways
to lay out data structure declarations.
